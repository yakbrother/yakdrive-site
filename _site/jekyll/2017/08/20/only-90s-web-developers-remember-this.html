<p>My mind was blown, many years ago, when I read David Siegelâ€™s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Killer-Web-Sites-Third-Generation/dp/1568302894">Creating Killer Websites</a>. Suddenly the world of internet design opened up to me, and I no longer made horribly ugly geocities pages with full-page text - I could use tables and invisible 1x1 gifs for layout! CSS came into the picture and we no longer had to have underlined links! Those days are long gone, but Zach Holman reminded folks about it in this post.</p>
