Hi folks! I've been a [travel blogger](http://www.yakbrother.com) off and on for quite some time, but this is a new move for me. Instead of posting design and programming content on Twitter and Facebook, I'll be posting it here. I've been inspired by the things I've read at [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) about hosting your own content instead of relying on businesses that may or may not fail and close - so I took a few days to put together a new Jekyll theme based on my old website, and I'm ready to try it out. Welcome!
