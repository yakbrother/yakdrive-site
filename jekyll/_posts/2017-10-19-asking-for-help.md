I'm happy to work in an environment where most of us are very comfortable asking
for help, and express our appreciation for each other constantly - but this
article is a great reminder of how to build professional relationships.

 This part is especially useful also:

> Take short notes during the process. These might be useful to you later. They
> also display appreciation and respect towards your coworker. Active learning
> is far more effective than passive learning, so participate as much as
> possible by speaking and writing.
>
> Pair programming takes a lot of energy. If you sense that you’re flagging, then
> don’t be afraid to say that you’re going to work on the problem on your own for
> a while. Be specific about how you will explore the problem so that they can
> leave you to it with confidence. This will keep you from zoning out.
